valuenetwork (NRP)
=====================

Status
---------

This version was forked from LearnDeep, which was forked from FreedomCoop, which was forked from Sensorica's original version of NRP.  Experience with NRP was one of the inputs to ValueFlows, so this version represents a prior state of the vocabulary.

This version will be used by Guerrilla Media Collective as a temporary measure, pending new software to be created for `DisCO <https://disco.coop/manifesto/>`_ organizations.  It is also possible that we will want to upgrade it to current versions of Python and Django, as well as the current VF vocabulary for the api, and general cleanup.
