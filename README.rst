A Value Network Accounting.

We mean Accounting in a large sense.  We are developing something analogous to an ERP system for value networks.
Might call it NRP for Network Resource Planning or OCP for Open Collaborative Platform.

More info abount NRP accounting: `Slide deck <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JEPsxJOjEMHNhvIGLXzcvovrpXqpoY75YaPHDKI0t9w/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000>`_.

See `docs <https://github.com/FreedomCoop/valuenetwork/tree/master/docs>`_ for developer installation instructions.

The valueaccounting app could be split out and used in other Django projects.
